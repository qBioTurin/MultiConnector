\usage{
validateCluster(CONNECTORDataClustered)

validateCluster(CONNECTORDataClustered)
}
\arguments{
\item{CONNECTORDataClustered}{A CONNECTORDataClustered object created with \code{selectCluster()}.
This should contain the final selected clustering configuration with cluster assignments
and membership probabilities.}
}
\value{
a list containing the combined plot and table with clustering metrics.

A list containing validation results:
\itemize{
\item \code{plot}: A combined ggplot2 visualization showing silhouette scores and entropy
distributions across clusters
\item \code{metrics}: A data frame with detailed clustering metrics including:
\itemize{
\item Silhouette scores (average and per-cluster)
\item Entropy measures (indicating cluster assignment uncertainty)
\item Cluster sizes and proportions
}
}
}
\description{
Validate clustering results by calculating and plotting silhouette and entropy metrics

Validates the quality of clustering results by calculating and visualizing key clustering metrics.
This function computes silhouette scores and entropy measures to assess cluster
separation. The results are presented both as numerical summaries and
comprehensive visualizations to help users evaluate clustering quality.
}
\details{
This function provides comprehensive cluster validation through multiple metrics:

\strong{Silhouette Analysis:}
\itemize{
\item Measures how well each curve fits within its assigned cluster
\item Values range from -1 to 1 (higher is better)
\item Identifies potential misclassified curves
}

\strong{Entropy Analysis:}
\itemize{
\item Quantifies uncertainty in cluster assignments
\item Lower entropy indicates more confident assignments
\item Helps identify curves with ambiguous cluster membership
}

The visualization includes boxplots, density plots, and summary statistics to provide
a comprehensive view of clustering quality.

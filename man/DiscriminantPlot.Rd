\title{Discriminant Analysis Plot}
\usage{
DiscriminantPlot(CONNECTORDataClustered, feature = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{CONNECTORDataClustered}{A CONNECTORDataClustered object created with \code{selectCluster()}.
This contains the clustered data along with cluster assignments and parameters.}

\item{feature}{Optional character string specifying a feature from the annotations to use for
coloring points. If NULL, points will be colored uniformly. Must match a column name
in the annotations data.}
}
\value{
A list containing ggplot2 or plotly objects:
\itemize{
\item \code{ColCluster}: Plot colored by cluster assignments
\item \code{ColFeature}: Plot colored by the specified feature (or uniform if feature=NULL)
}
For 3D cases, returns interactive plotly objects. For 1D and 2D cases, returns ggplot2 objects.
}
\description{
Creates discriminant analysis plots to visualize clustering results in reduced dimensional space.
This function generates both cluster-colored and feature-colored visualizations, automatically
adapting the plotting approach based on the dimensionality of the data (1D, 2D, or 3D with PCA).
For high-dimensional cases, PCA is applied to reduce dimensionality for visualization.
}
\details{
The function automatically determines the appropriate visualization based on data dimensionality:
\itemize{
\item \strong{1D}: Scatter plot with alpha values vs standard deviation
\item \strong{2D}: 2D scatter plot with convex hulls around clusters
\item \strong{3D+}: PCA reduction, then either 2D plot (if first 2 PCs explain >99\% variance)
or interactive 3D plot
}

Each plot includes cluster centers and appropriate legends. The feature coloring allows
exploration of how clinical/experimental features relate to the discovered clusters.

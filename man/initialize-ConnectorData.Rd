\title{Create CONNECTORData Object}
\usage{
\S4method{initialize}{CONNECTORData}(.Object, curves, dimensions, annotations, TimeGrids)
}
\arguments{
\item{TimeSeriesFile}{Either a character string specifying the path to an Excel/CSV file
containing time series data, or a tibble with pre-loaded data. The data must contain
columns: \code{time}, \code{ID} (subject identifier), \code{value}, and at least one
measurement column (e.g., treatment responses, biomarkers).}

\item{AnnotationFile}{Either a character string specifying the path to an Excel/CSV file
containing annotation data, or a tibble with pre-loaded annotations. Must contain an
\code{ID} column matching the time series data, plus additional feature columns
(e.g., demographics, treatment groups, clinical variables).}
}
\value{
A CONNECTORData S4 object containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{curves}: Tibble with columns (subjID, measureID, time, curvesID, value)
storing the processed time series data
\item \code{dimensions}: Tibble reporting the number of observations per sample
\item \code{annotations}: Tibble matching samples with their feature annotations
\item \code{TimeGrids}: List of time grids for each measurement type
}
The function also prints a summary including total curves, minimum/maximum curve lengths.
}
\description{
Creates a CONNECTORData object by importing and processing time series data and annotations.
This is the primary entry point for the MultiConnector package, converting raw data files
or tibbles into a structured format suitable for clustering analysis. The function handles
data validation, processing, and creates time grids for each measurement type.
}
\details{
\strong{Data Requirements:}
\itemize{
\item Time series file must have: 'time', 'ID', 'value', and measurement columns
\item Annotation file must have: 'ID' matching the time series, plus feature columns
\item IDs must be consistent between time series and annotation files
}

\strong{Supported File Formats:}
\itemize{
\item Excel files (.xlsx, .xls)
\item CSV/text files (.csv, .txt)
\item R tibbles (for programmatic use)
}
}
